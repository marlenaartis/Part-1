    <p>Game Designer, Digital Artist</p>

    <p align="center"> Terrifying Jellyfish is a 21 year-old<br />game designer and digital artist based<br />in St. Louis, Missouri. He has<br />officially released two games, Feesh<br />and SmuggleCraft, and later this year<br />will release NOUR, an "experimental<br />foot art game with no goals or<br />objectives." Here, the designer chats<br /> about the childhood fixation that lead<br />him to making games of his own, the<br />process by which his digital food art evolved into an actual<br />game, and the ways in which digital creators can avoid losing<br />their mind from working alone too much.</p>

      <p style="font-size:60px;">Terrifying Jellyfish on making games out of food
<p align="center">You've been making games since you were 13. Was it just sort of a<br />natural progression for you, going from loving games to making them?</p>
  <br />
<p align="center">It did feel like a pretty natural progression. I've always had an<br />interest in games. The first console I ever had was a Sega Genesis<br />and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was the firt game I played that had such a<br />huge influence on me. To this day that game inspires the colors that<br />I use and the vibe and enthusiasm I try to put into my work. That<br />game was just really formative for me and I loved it so much.</p>
      <br />
        <p align="center">After playing the game for a while we discovered the debug mode<br />cheat, which allowed you to go around the map and place things in<br />the game. It was pretty much just a testing tool for the developers,<br />but that really inspired me. It revealed to me an extra layer that<br />goes on beneath the surface of the game that the average player<br />doesn't even know about. I think that's what subconsciously inspired<br />me to pursue this, even before I knew what went into games or that<br />it was something that I could do. Because of that I was telling<br />people, "Oh yeah, I want to be a game designer when I grow up"... but<br />never did I think I would actually accomplish that.</p>

<br />
<p align="center">Do you remember the first thing that you made where you're like,<br />"Oh, this is actually a real thing. This is more than just a hobby<br />or something I do for fun. This feels real."</p>
<br />
<p align="center">The second I got my first scipt working, and even more so the<br />second I made something move on the screen-that was such a huge<br />moment for me. To this day it still doesn't get old. The first time<br />you see something on the screen move because of code you've written<br />is just like, "Wow." You feel like it's way more in your grasp than<br />you'd ever thought possible. I remember jumping up and almost being<br />teary I was so happy. I was just like, "Yo, I bt I can make a full<br />game."</p>
<br />
<p align="center">Looking at your website, it seems like your entire identity as a<br />creator/designer is already to fully realized. Your games are all<br />visible, you link out to your collaborators, and you have merch for<br />sale. How did you develop you identity? Was it something you had<br />in mind from the beginning?</p>
<br />
<p align="center">Yeah. I've always had this visual aesthetic. I always loved<br />designin logos for things. I  love picking out color schemes. I<br />loved graphic design even before I knew what "graphic design" was.<br />Even back in the days when all I had was MS Paint I would sometimes<br />draw out website layouts and stuff just because it was fun. Later on<br />when it was time to actually create an identitfy for Terrifying<br />Jellyfish I was like, "Okay, I'll just make it as neat as possible<br />and I'll make it as colorful as I see it in my head. I'm just gonna<br />make it super me." That's how it started. When I started the company<br />in 2014, I was 18. I already knew what kind of stuff I liked and<br />what I wanted it to be and what direction I wanted the brand to go<br />in simply because I knew I wanted something that appealed perfectly<br />to my own interests. I only worried about pleasing myself. It<br />evolved from there.</p>
<br />

</p>
  <p align="center">What drew you specifically towards creating games as opposed to<br />being a graphic designer or a a video artist? What is it about games<br />that appeals to you?</p>
  <br />
    <p align="center">Well, I love expressing myself in a different mediums. I also do video<br />work every now and then or I'll do something 2D just to try<br />something different. there's a lot of platforms that I want to<br />express myself in. I can never have enough creative outlets, but I<br />always come back to games because they feel so exciting to me. I<br />think that's in part because of what a relatively new genre it is.<br />With video games, I feel like there's so many permutations of what<br />you can do with that platform and still so little that's been<br />explored. So many games are just derivative of each other, so<br />there's still space to create something completely new and that<br />hasn't been seen before. A lot of indie games are going in that<br />direction. It's uncharted territory.</p>
    <br />
    <p align="center">You'll soon be releasing NOUR, a game you funded on Kickstarted. What was the impetus to make a game all about food?</p>
    <br />
    <p align="center">It literally started with a bowl of ramen and a cup of bubble tea. I<br />knew that there was already a culture around those kind of food<br />items because when I'd scroll through Tumblr or twitter I'd see<br />endless pictures of ramen or bubble tea, these really beautiful,<br />stylized photos. I'd see lots of food pics on all of these artsy<br />looking blogs with these amaxing colors and well-composed pictures<br />of food. I was interested in that. I was like, "Okay, there really<br />is a whole aesthetic surrounding food, especially ones using soft<br />colors that kind of match and convey the flavor through the way they<br />look." I became interested in that concept so I first made the<br />bubble tea just as a test to see if that was something I could do in<br />3D. It was literally just an art test to see if I could create a shader that stimulates bubble tea.</p>
    <br />
    <p align="center">
    <img src="popcorn.gif" alt="popcorn" width="750" height="305">
    </p>
    <br />
    <p align="center">So I did that and uploaded it to Twitter and the response was great.<br />People were like, "oh my gosh, as soon as I saw that the flavor<br /> appeared into my mouth." I thought that was interesting, so I did<br />the same with my ramen scene and once again the response was the<br />same. The original tweet I made about it blew up. It was a little<br />video I recorded of noodles falling into a bowl and then meat<br />following it. People's responses inspired me to  make more of it.</p>
        <br />
      <p align="center">After I showed those off, a friend of mine was throwing an event and<br />wanted me to show something at it. He was wondering if I could show<br />my food art in some way. And I was like, "Well, I make games so what<br />better way to do this than to try to make a game out of it." Since<br />it was an art show and not really a games show, I just made it to<br />where you could press buttons to interect with the food-like buttons<br />that popped the popcorn or whatever. That was the first interaction of<br />the game, before I even knew it was gona be a game. It was just<br />playing with your food. People loved it. I found it interesting that<br />it was a game that could fit within this art space. It was engaging<br />enough while also not having any scores or objectives or the rules<br />of any other traditional game.</p>
          <br />
        <p align="center">It's described online as a game with no goals or objectives. What is<br />it about that particularly that appeals to you?
            <br />
          <p align="center">To me it's something that makes the game a lot more accessible.<br />Sometimes when I'm at game events I see people appoach a game, but<br />they won't really play it themselves because they're afraid that<br />they're going to do it wrong, or they're gonna lose, or they're<br />gonna mess something up. They feel the need to perform, so they'll<br />just watch someone else play because they're too scared to play it<br />themselves. I've found that with a game with no goals or objective<br />people will see that the experience is open. You get out of it<br />exactly what you put into it. There's no wrong way to do it.</p>
            <br />
          <p align="center">I've seen it at many game events. Someone will come up skittishly,<br />press the button, and just see what happens. When they see that that<br />something fun and rewarding happens, then they press another button.<br />By the end of it, they're smiling and mashing buttons and it's an<br />amazing experience. At the same time, anyone can enjoy it. You don't<br />have to be a gamer at all. You can just eperience it as an art<br />piece. Anyone can just walk up to it and interact with it.</p>
              <br />

              </p>
            <p align="center">Competitive games reach into our inner instincts to compete and be<br />the best and do something grandiose. Those kinds of games increase<br />tension. They increasingly raise the stakes, which can be stressful.<br />That's why some people like them. With something like NOUR, a game<br />with no real objective or way to do it wrong, it's a completely<br />different experience because you are simply pleasing yourself by<br />making something satisfying happen on the screen. It's about<br />satisfaction-here's your expectation and here's the immediate<br />feedback from your input. It's something completely different from<br />what people expect games to be.</p>
              <br />
            <p align="center">When you're doing the kind of work that involves coding and hours<br />spent staring at a computer screen, how do you keep from burning out<br />and going crazy?</p>
                <br />
              <p align="center">This is a problem I've run into recently. Something that I didn't<br />realize about working for yourself was just that a lot of times<br />you'll end up inside the house and you won't leave for days on end.<br />You'll just notice, "Oh, hey, I just haven't seen another human in a<br />day or two." I used to work in an office, so it's only recently that<br />I became self-employed. Before, there was a place to go to every<br />day. There was an environment that was changing and brand new every<br />day. There were people.</p>
                <br />
                <p align="center">
                <img src="ramen.gif" alt="ramen" width="630" height="320">
                </p>
              <p align="center">When you're working from home you don't really get that. You go stir<br />crazy. You get cabin fever. If you work alone with a computer,<br />something really important for your mental health and your<br />productivity is to figure out how are you going to have ineraction<br />with other people. How are you going to satisfy your other human<br />needs other than working? There's a lot of ways to manage that,<br />whether it be taking walk breaks or hitting up your friends. I think<br />it's important just to reach out to other people who are also<br />working freelance and be like, "Hey, want to work in the same<br />space?" Just to have that kind of flow. It makes you a lot more<br />cognizant of what you need to make yourself mentally happy. I would<br />say that if you don't ignore those signs then that's a good way to<br />prevent burn out. Your work will also improve if you remember to<br />take breaks, clear your head, and not get lost in it.</p>
                  <br />
                <p align="center">How do you get feedback? Do you have a trusted network of people to<br />share things with?</p>
                  <br />
                <p align="center">If it's something that would really require a designer's eye to test<br />out, I do have a select channel of other developers from all over<br />that I can talk to. It's definitely a good idea to create a network<br />of other people that are doing what you're doing so that you can<br />test out ideas, ask them what they think of things, etc. You often<br />need honest, open criticism of what you're doing. I ask friends if I<br />want an actual opinion from a player on what to do about things.<br />Sometimes, especially if it's just a little art thing that's<br />unfinished or whatever, I'll put it out to Tumblr or Twitter jus to<br />be like, "Hey, look at this neat little thing that I did. It's not<br />finished, what do you think?" It's important to show what you're<br />working on to different kinds of audiences.</p>

                  </p>
                <p align="center">Knowing now how much time and energy it takes to bring a game to<br />fruition-including development and raising the money, etc-how do you<br />decide which projects to pursue? Do you just go where the energy<br />seems to be?</p>
                  <br />
                <p align="center">It can be difficult to figure that out because what you're excited<br />about might not be what everyone else is excited about. I think a<br />really important part of figuring out what project to tackle next is<br />just not getting feedback. It shows you that people around you are<br />indeed interested in this and if you were to pursue it that it would<br />be a really good endeavor, which is something that will motivate you<br />more to work on it. Often with games you'll find that your drive to<br />make something won't last as long as it will take to actually make<br />it. By the time you're six months into development you're like, "All<br />right. I'm over this idea. I want to work on something else."</p>
                  <br />
                <p align="center">If you get that active feedback from other players, other developers<br />early on, and if you see that they really like what you're doing and<br />they really like the idea, then that will motivate you to the finish<br />line. Just show people, get a guage of interest, but also listen to<br />yourself and listen to see if your heart is saying that this is a<br />project you truly want to work on.</p>
                  <br />

                  </p>
                <p align="center">You really have to feel it. For example, NOUR was a project I never<br />intented to be a full game, but it was the response of people on<br />Twitter and on Tumblr that drove me to make it. Thinking about it<br />now, it almost felt like it was a gift, "Oh, people want more of<br />this and I'm the only person who can give it to them? Here you go."<br />It's a super good feeling when people like something that you love<br />to work on and they want more of it.</p>
